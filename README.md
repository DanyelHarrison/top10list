Testing Coverage: 78.3%
Top 10 List Spring Boot project 

An attempt at a full stack Spring Boot application, in this instance, an application which allows a user to create a top 10 list based on a category, chosen from a pre-defined list. The application uses an H2 database and is theoretically able to store lists, and entries which both have CRUD functionality attached to them.

# Startup

To run this application you will need to install the following pre-requisites:
- Java 1.8 or later (Java 17 used for production)
- An IDE of your choice, Eclipse was used during creation.
- MySQL installed on your machine
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript

# Tools
Project Management Board - Trello
IDE - Eclipse (Backend) VSCode (Front-end)
Project Build - Maven
Front-end Languages - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-end Languages - Java
LucidChard - ERD/UML diagrams
Microsoft Excel - Risk Assessment

# Testing
Testing was done using JUnit and Mockito for Unit Testing, tests were run across different classes and is currently at 73.3% coverage.
Test Driven development was attempted, however I am not yet comfortable enough with testing to do this effectively, and just led to having to change the tests to suit the functions later down the line. Thankfully I don't plan on being a tester. 

To run the tests, once this repo has been cloned, open it up within your IDE, right click the project and click on Coverage as > Junit Test. this will run all tests and give you a final coverage number.

#Final Remarks
During this project I definitely took the wrong approach, Instead of starting with an incredibly simple application to meet the MVP and moving from there, I started with a plan which was far too complex, however by the time I had realised my mistake, there was not enough time to feasibly start again.

In future I will make sure to hit MVP as simply as possible, before further developing my projects and adding complexity.
